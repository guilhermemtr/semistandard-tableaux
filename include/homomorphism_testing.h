// Have a map from the generators (of the semistandard tableaux) to other mathematical elements (tuples of tropical matrices)

// If we have an homomorphism we know that
// If we know the images of a generator, we can compute the image of the product

// Need to check if this gives us a well defined homomorphism: Check if the image(yxz) \equiv image(yzx)

// Check if the two sides of the Knuth relations

// If we take two words that represent the same object, then we have to check if those two words, using the homomorphism, map to the same element.





// Have two distinct loops for checking each Knuth relation (one of them is in a pic of my phone).
