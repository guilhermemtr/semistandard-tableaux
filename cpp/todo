FEATURES:
finish implementing the semistandard tableaux.
document everything
test everything

check how I am saying that tableaux is friend of free monoid, in the free_monoid header.

consider changing the implementation of the free monoid to have a size and a counter, instead of only having a length (which requires constant memory management).

Later: use fseek to let the user know which line the error is in, when reading input from files.
Try getting the line number, the column number and the file number.
