implement the create tuple entry for all data types.
implement a "this suffix is mine" function for each of the data types.
finish implementing the read and write of tuples.


To do now:
1) Reading and Writing tuples from and to files
2) Create a tuple_entry_create for each of the types of element.
3) Create a "this suffix is mine" function for each tye of element (and use it to load elements?). [How to load arbitrary type of input files? See how I did it in the semistandard tableaux pool when reading from a directory]
3) Test of homomorphisms
4) Reading and (Writing?) of Homomorphisms from and to files

To do:
1) Implement the "special" read/write of tuples (tuples of tropical matrices)
2) Unit testing
3) Rename variables (include the project name "Plactic Identities" -> "PlacId" -> "plac_id")
4) Parsing arguments
5) Improving the performance of identity testing (Leave for C++ implementation)
6) Generating random tableaux (which for now is done in Python)
